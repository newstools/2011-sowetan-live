PREVIOUSLY disadvantaged North West citizens will now have an opportunity to empower themselves through gambling The North West Gambling Board and Department of Economic Development and Tourism launched the first limited payout machine in Mahikeng yesterday. Board provincial manager Fortune Sekgaphane said the licensing of limited payout machines would expand existing casinos and provide new entertainment and recreational facilities across the province. "Unlike casinos, limited payout machines will be distributed more widely throughout the province." he said. Five payout machines were installed in Uncle Sam's pub at Megacity. Gamblers will only bet with R5 and the jackpot will be R500. Sekgaphane explained that the roll out would provide an excellent economic opportunity for previously disadvantaged individuals to take part meaningfully in the economy of North West. Sekgaphane said the roll-out would also enhance economic growth and development in the province by facilitating the participation of small and medium business and the empowerment of previously disadvantaged individuals in the gambling industry. "It is critical for us to continue to facilitate the entry of small and medium business in the gambling industry, and the licensing of limited payout machines presents us with a perfect opportunity to do this," Sekgaphane said He said the capital required to fund the infrastructure for the roll-out of limited payout machines was less than that of building a casino. This offers a major opportunity to small and medium businesses to be part of the gambling industry. Sekgaphane said the roll-out of limited payout machines would help eradicateillegal gambling. Receiving his operation licence the owner of Uncle Sam's pub in Mahikeng, Braz da Costa, was ecstatic to be the first business owner in the province to hold a gambling licence. "This will definitely boost my business, I am very happy." He said he had already hired four people for this venture.
