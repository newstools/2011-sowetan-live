STRASBOURG - Uefa president Michel Platini urged European countries to introduce tougher laws to curb match-fixing in a speech to the Council of Europe yesterday. The former France captain, who has described match-fixing orchestrated by gambling rings as the biggest threat to the sport, said a few countries had introduced laws but others needed to follow suit. "European football is in danger and I believe the whole of sport in Europe is in danger," he said. "The growing number of fixed matches connected to online betting is alarming. "These fixed matches are orchestrated by criminal organisations," he said. Platini named Italy, Portugal, Spain, Britain, Bulgaria and Poland as some of the countries that had laws to make "sporting fraud" a criminal offence. "It's a question of responsibility, a question of ethics, a question of justice."
